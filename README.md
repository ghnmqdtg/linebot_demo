# LineBot_demo
## Introduction
Integrating with the [work I did](https://github.com/ghnmqdtg/Get_weather_CWB) before, the line bot currently can tell user how the weather is (Taiwan only). All the weather data are from CWB opendata API.


## Preparation
1. Sign in a line developer account and set up a provider. ([Tutorial](https://developers.line.biz/zh-hant/docs/messaging-api/getting-started/#%E5%BB%BA%E7%AB%8B-channel))
2. Understand how to fetch data from the CWB opendata API.
3. Basic knowledge of line bot SDK.
4. Ngrok for local testing.
5. A Heroku account for online publishing.


## Function
The chatbot can only reply user particular word and how current weather is, since it just a demo version.

The following are demonstrations:
